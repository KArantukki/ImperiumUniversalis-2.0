 CYRUS_THE_GREAT_TITLE:0 "§O559 BC§! - Cyrus The Great"
 CYRUS_THE_GREAT_DESC:0 "'Diversity in counsel, unity in command.' -Cyrus the Great\nTensions have risen in the Median Empire. The current dominant force is increasingly becoming challenged by the ever-increasing power of the Persians. Although King Cyrus of Persia recognizes Median over-lordship, it would not last for long. Harpagus was to take charge of the Median Army in this inevitable war, but he would side with Cyrus, bringing several nobility and a portion of the army with him. Civil War would ravage Media and Persia for three years, and it would be until the capture of Ecbatana would the Median Empire's collapse, and out of the dust would be the Empire of Persia, ruled by the King of Kings."

Later, in 499BC, the ruler of Miletus, a small city on the coast of Anatolia, would embark on a expedition against Naxos with Persian support. The failure led to the Ionian Revolt which lasted to 493 BC. When the Athenians and Eretrians aided rioters in Sardis, The Persian King Darius the Great would vow revenge against them, and to conquer the entirity of Hellas. The first invasion in 492 BC would last until the decisive Athenian Victory at the Battle of Marathon, setting back the Persians for some time."

 FPW_NAME:0 "§O264 BC§! - First Punic War"
 FPW_DESC:0 "'You aren't defeated unless you accept defeat' -Roman saying\nTwo great powers have risen in the Mediterranean Sea. Carthage is a sprawling Mercantile Empire from North Africa and Iberia, and the Romans are a Militaristic Republic who are the recent conquerors of most of Italy. The islands that border them, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, were under constant dispute between the two powers. Eventually, Italian pirates would take a Carthaginian City, but be pardoned by Carthage. Afterwards, they appealed to the Romans, as they are Italian, and would ask for help in fighting Carthage. What would come is a twenty year long war that consisted of over a million men, and end with Sicily becoming a province SPQR."
 SPW_NAME:0 "§O218 BC§! - Second Punic War"
 SPW_DESC:0 "'Never be a friend to Rome.' -Hasdrubal and Hannibal Barca, swearing a Oath of hatred against Rome\nWhen Carthage capitulated in the First Punic War, Hasdrubal Barca, a military leader, would feel betrayed due to his winnings being lost by the surrender. After defeating his army, which were of mercenaries that were disappointed that Carthage could not pay them for the war, he would lead a new army into Iberia and establish a sort of Kingdom of his own. After his death, the new ruler, also called Hasdrubal, would sign a treaty with Rome to set the border at the Ebro River. After that Hasdrubal's death, Hannibal would rise. He demanded that the city of Saguntum, and led to Hannibal's rise as a Military Genius and a war for the Mediterranean."

 PEL_WAR_DESC:0 "'Only the dead have seen the end of war.' -Plato\nAs the Athenians had fought back the Persians time and time again would worry the Spartans, Athenai's greatest rival, and eventually led to war between the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta, against the Delian League, led by Athenai. It would go in Athen's favor until a botched invasion of Sicily, and a epidemic of a Plague in Athens, possibly the Bubonic Plague's first appearance, led to the war falling in Sparta's favor. This phase is when Sparta received support from Persia, and launched a assault against Athens. The city would be captured, and the Spartans imposed numerous peace demands, including the destruction of the Athenian Navy."
 WARRING_STATES_TITLE:0 "§O402 BC§! - The Warring States"
 WARRING_STATES_DESC:0 "'The path that can be walked is not always the path; the name that can be named is not always the name.' -Laozi\nThe fuedal states created by the Zhou dynasty has changed. The diminishment of their power, and the Spring and Autumn periods, had left many states gaining power and no dependencies on central authority for the protection of their land. Many rulers would proclaim the Gods had favored them, and used it as justification for conquest and the spread of their infulence. The Qin dynasty would be able to conquer neighboring rulers, including the Zhao. With the destruction of the Zhou Dynasty upon the death of King Nan and Xiaowen would leave the state easy picking for the Qin, and thus uniting China under their own mandate of Heaven. At least, for now."

In 334, he invaded Persia and began multiple campaigns that would strech for ten years. After the conquest of Anatolia, Alexander broke Persia through a series of decisive battles, including the Battles of Issus and Gaugamela. His army would march into the Fertile Crescent, Sands of Egypt, and Mountains of Persia, and overthrew Darius III and conquered the Persian Empire entirely, but his unexpected death led to the shredding of his work."
 RISE_OF_MACEDONIA_TITLE:0 "§O359 BC§! - Rise of Macedon"
 RISE_OF_MACEDONIA_DESC:0 "'My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you.' -Philip II\nThe aftermath of the Peloponnesian War left to Spartan Dominance over Greece. It would go into war against Corinth to try to prove this point, but would only lead to Persia taking back Ionia. With the Thebans revolting and gaining independence would Sparta start to fall as the dominant force in Greece. In the North, Macedon lost Perdiccas III and 4,000 troops to the Dardanian tribe in Illyria, leading to Philip II's rise to King as Macedon. Athens attempted to recover Amphipolis, which would lead to War between the two states. It would be decided in the Battle of Methone where Philip won a major victory, and opened the path for a powerful Macedon."
 PYRRIC_WAR_TITLE:0 "§O280 BC§! - Pyrric War"
 PYRRIC_WAR_DESC:0 "\"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.\" -Phyrrhus\nAs Rome's influence in southern Italy increased, there was a split in the Greek states on the Italian Penninsula. The Aristrocrats believed that Rome can be worked with, but the Republicans feared Rome. After Rome broke a treaty with Republican Tarentum, the city sunk the Roman Ships and refused reparations to Rome. Once war began, the Tarentines asked Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, to fight in the war. As he landed in Italy, the Romans met him up in Heraclea. A brutal battle came after, and though Pyrrhus won the battle, he had heavy losses on his side. After facing many devastating battles, he lost the Battle of Beneventum, and gave up on the War. And so, was coined the term Pyrrhic Victory."

The people loved Caesar, and no longer trusted the Senate, and now two important claims to be his Successor are about to clash. Octavian, the Great-Nephew of Caesar, against Marcus Anthony and Cleopatra, with Cleopatra once being a lover of Caesar.

 CCW_TITLE:0 "§O49 BC§! - Caesar's Civil War"
 CCW_DESC:0 "\"Veni, Vidi, Vici\" - Caesar\nThe old alliance between Caesar and Pompey is gone. After going on campaigns out of Italia, Pompey was being declared as sole Consul; without Caesar.
