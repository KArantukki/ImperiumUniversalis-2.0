 superior_religious_6:0 "Teach them our Culture"
 superior_religious_6_desc:0 "When we take lands, we see those that do different practices and ways of life than our own. It is important to integrate them into our society and culture, and one way we can do that is to send our People of Superior Culture into the lands that need them, where the people can enlighten the province and bring them towards a way of life that is similar to what we do."
 superior_religious_7:0 "High Priests"
 superior_religious_7_desc:0 "The initiation of High Priests into our society has been a major success, with them converting many people towards the truth.

 maritime_4:0 "Combative Merchant Navy"
 maritime_4_desc:0 "The Boats of Merchants are not weaponless. They have defensive and offensive ways to combat pirates and privateers that attempt to attack them. But, they are not the best.

 maritime_5:0 "Tough Sailors"
 maritime_5_desc:0 "Life at the Sea is tough. Only the strongest can return home with a intact boat. If these ships sink, so do precious weapons, men, and guns that could have been great use.

 maritime_6:0 "Hire Foreign Shipbuilders"

 imperial_government_3:0 "Loyal Subjects"
 imperial_government_3_desc:0 "Our vassals are those who retain a sort of independance, but view us as their overlords. If they are loyal to us, we should reward them. Disloyal should either become loyal or be squashed under our might. Let us give rewards to those that become loyal, and contribute to our nation."
 imperial_government_4:0 "Mercenary Army"
 imperial_government_4_desc:0 "As we grow, the use of Mercenaries will also follow us. They can be the definitive question over the tide of a war, and they can be of good use to us. But they are expensive. In order to stop us from falling into a deep debt from them, we should set a new reform which will have them cost less money."
 imperial_government_5:0 "The Enemy of my Enemy ..."
 imperial_government_5_desc:0 ".. is my friend. Those that wish to honorably fight against the evils of our rivals are impressive people.

 imperial_government_6:0 "Skilled Government"
 imperial_government_6_desc:0 "As our nation grows, so does our government, and the requirements of States within the lands that we gain.

 imperial_government_7_desc:0 "As our nation takes land, it will encourage others to attempt to dethrone our rightful rule and take away lands that are rightfully ours.

Certainly, we know which way the wind is blowing, and we will take this oppertunity."
 naval_2:0 "Oak Wood"
 naval_2_desc:0 "As long as we remember, our ships have been made out of a certain type of wood. However, it would not be needed to remember that anymore.

This new type of wood is far stronger, and will help keep our ships afloat when in combat."
 naval_3:0 "Boarding Parties"
 naval_3_desc:0 "The art of boarding onto another ship is not foreign to us. It is a simple form of naval combat that, when done correctly, can be a very good combat tool.

 naval_5:0 "Naval Academies"
 naval_5_desc:0 "As our officers grow and develop as soldiers in the navy, one of the most disheartening things to see is one of our ships being sunk into the ocean, with the screams of its men ringing in their ears.

This can be done with a hard drilling at Naval Academies, in order to make sure that they are not too attached and focus on the fight."
 naval_6:0 "Advanced Shipdesign"
 naval_6_desc:0 "Our navy is widely important to our people and to our army. This will come that there is no suprise in the fact that our ships must be superior to ships of other nations.
